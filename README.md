As a dedicated researcher interested in leveraging artificial intelligence for healthcare solutions, I have co-authored a research paper titled "Diabetic Retinopathy Detection." This work focuses on the early detection of diabetic retinopathy using advanced deep-learning techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Our study presents a novel classifier based on the MobileNetV2 architecture, achieving an impressive accuracy of 96%, with precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95, 0.98, and 0.97, respectively. The proposed model aims to assist ophthalmologists by providing a reliable tool for early diagnosis, ultimately reducing the risk of vision loss in diabetic patients.

Key Contributions:
Developed a deep learning model utilizing MobileNetV2 for the early detection of diabetic retinopathy.
They trained and tested the model on the Aptos 2019 dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance metrics.
We are focused on creating a lightweight, mobile-friendly architecture suitable for deployment in clinical settings.
She has contributed to the literature review, highlighting advancements and comparisons with existing models in the field.
It aims to integrate the model into a user-friendly application for widespread clinical use.
